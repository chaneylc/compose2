## :scroll: Description
Incomplete 'speed-run' compose project. Only spent time equal to what it would take without compose. Android Studio crashes.
What's more scary is when previews are inconsistent with the device layout. Overall, I really like compose but some parts
are confusing and it's hard to learn when the studio crashes or previews lag.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I tried to use a list parameter to create the home page chip row. Ended up with some weird layouts causing the last button to extend vertically.
